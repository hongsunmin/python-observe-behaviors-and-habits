# Introduction
After reading the book "정리하는 뇌”(English Books in their Original Language "The Organized Mind”), I realized the importance of planning, taking action, and following up regularly to make sure I'm on track.

And i got the idea from ["Quantified Self Part 6 - 생산적인 하루에 대한 정량적인 표현과 4년간의 데이터 이야기"](https://dongjunlee.github.io/quantified%20self/QS_Part_6_Analysis_My_Life/) and started working on it.

I use an iPhone shortcut app to record my daily weather and at the end of the day my emotional state, behaviors, and habits as a CSV file.

Then I use the script to periodically check in to see how well it's executing as planned.

I'm modifying the script to observe my behavior more carefully.
